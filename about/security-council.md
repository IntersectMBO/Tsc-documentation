#### What is the Security Council:

The Security Council (SC) is a dedicated group responsible for ensuring the security, integrity, and reliability of the Cardano blockchain ecosystem, facilitated by Intersect. Comprising key stakeholders, the SC focuses on developing and enforcing security policies, managing incident responses, and mitigating risks within the ecosystem.

#### The Council is responsible for:

1. Incident Response:\
   Develop and maintain a comprehensive incident response plan to effectively address and manage critical incident response and “alarm bell” management. This includes performing root cause analysis to prevent future occurrences, ensure rapid recovery by appointing a Security Manager.
2. Risk Management:\
   Identify, assess, record, and mitigate security risks to protect the Cardano blockchain ecosystem. Implement proactive measures to minimize potential threats and vulnerabilities like a risk register.
3. Security Policies:\
   Develop, review, and enforce security policies and standards to ensure consistent protection across the ecosystem. These policies provide guidelines and procedures to maintain security integrity.
4. Vulnerability Management:\
   Conduct regular vulnerability assessments to identify and address weaknesses in the system. Manage remediation efforts to ensure timely / effective resolution of identified vulnerabilities through a process for assessment, budget, audit and record for audits.  Security Council acts as representative, acts as Subject Matter Experts for these topics around budgets and discloses the findings as appropriate.
5. Security Awareness:\
   Educate stakeholders and community members on security best practices and emerging threats. Foster a security-aware culture to enhance the overall security posture of the ecosystem through educational outreach opportunities as appropriate.
6. Security Assessment of Code:\
   Assess the quality and security of contracts and code for integrations, edits, and compliance, ensuring adherence to security standards and best practices. Manage and allocate budget for these assessments as necessary.

#### Guiding Principles:

* Confidentiality: Ensure sensitive information is restricted to those who need to know.
* Integrity: Maintain the accuracy and reliability of data and systems.

#### Mission of the Security Council:

"To establish and maintain a robust security posture for the Cardano blockchain ecosystem by effectively managing security risks, responding to incidents, and fostering a security-aware community.”

#### Authority:

The Council operates and reports to the Technical Steering Committee but acts autonomously for the betterment of Cardano. It is accountable for overseeing the security processes, managing incident responses, and ensuring compliance with security policies.

#### **Strategic Pillars:**

1. Core Cardano Security:\
   Ensure the security and integrity of the core Cardano blockchain by implementing rigorous security measures and protocols. Focus on safeguarding the foundational infrastructure of the ecosystem.
2. Rapid Incident Response:\
   Develop and maintain a swift and effective incident response strategy. Ensure rapid detection, containment, and resolution of security incidents to minimize impact and ensure continuity.
3. Technical Sustainability:\
   Promote the long-term technical sustainability of the Cardano ecosystem by implementing robust security practices. Ensure ongoing maintenance, updates, and improvements to protect against emerging threats and vulnerabilities.

In these Areas (Strategic Pillars), we aim for:

1. To establish and maintain a robust security process for the Cardano blockchain.
2. To coordinate and manage incident response activities.
3. To develop and implement security policies, procedures, and best practices.
4. To provide regular security assessments and audits.
5. To educate and inform the community on security-related matters.

#### Voting Procedure:

1. In Person or Video Meeting Voting Procedures: All topics on which the Council will take a vote will need a simple working group majority tallied during the meeting, tally and action to be recorded by the Secretary.
2. Offline Voting Procedures: All topics on which the Council will take a vote will need a simple working group majority tallied with any tool the Council agrees to utilize. Current voting procedure utilizes Slack where one or multiple topics will be posted to also for working group comments and the ability to mark a vote based on emojis as dictated by the post instructions. A simple majority of the correct emoji is needed to continue proceedings.
3. No Vote: In the event of a no vote or insufficient vote, topics or items will then be shelved or facilitated to revision based on the nature of the vote.
4. A vote by a WG: should be considered binding if it receives a simple majority of positive votes from a quorum consisting of at least two thirds of the working group members being present and participating in the vote
5. In the case of an emergency: this process may be circumvented in the best interest of resolution and then followed on by this process as appropriate.

#### Membership Criteria:

* The SC will be composed of members from the Intersect organization and other stakeholders within the Cardano ecosystem.
* Members will be selected based on their expertise in blockchain technology, cybersecurity, and incident response.

#### Proposed Roles for Security Council:

1. Chairperson: Lead the SC, coordinate meetings, and ensure the group achieves its objectives.
2. Incident Response Lead: Oversee the development and execution of the incident response plan.
3. Risk Manager: Identify and assess security risks, and develop mitigation strategies.
4. Policy Coordinator: Develop and maintain security policies and standards.
5. Community Liaison: Educate and inform the community about security practices and threats.
6. Security Assessment liaison
